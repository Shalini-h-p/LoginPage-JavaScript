  <p>I recently graduated from Athlone Institute of Technology. I have earned a master's degree in Software Engineering.
    I am exposed to Agile Software Development, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Scrum, Pair-Programming, and
    Test-driven Development. I have shown/proven my ability by developing Full Stack Web applications in Java Spring
    boot and similar frameworks listed in my Github profile. With this knowledge and personal experience in the
    development of web applications, I'm looking for opportunities in Ireland to work as a Software Engineer. I'm an
    experienced Software Engineer trained in ABC Technical Training Institute in both Development and Testing profiles
    in Java. I have experience with developing web applications in various frameworks personally. I have a real passion
    for programming and software development because it challenges me and it allows me to use my problem-solving skills
    more effectively. Although I've just graduated, I am very eager and motivated to learn and develop my skills even
    further and challenge myself even more.</p>
